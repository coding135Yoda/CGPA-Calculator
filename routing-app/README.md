# **CGPA Calculator**

*Summary:*  
The "CGPA Calculator" website project is a tool for students to effortlessly calculate their CGPA by inputting their grades and credits. It provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies academic performance tracking.

## **Project Overview:**

- **Purpose:** A web application designed to help students calculate their CGPA (Cumulative Grade Point Average) by inputting their grades and credits.

- **Technology Stack:**
  - **Frontend:** ReactJS for building interactive user interfaces.
  - **Rendering:** Utilized React's rendering capabilities to dynamically update the CGPA based on user input.
  - **JavaScript:** Handled the logic for grade and credit calculations.
  - **HTML & CSS:** Structured the layout and styled the application for a user-friendly experience.

## **Development Process:**

- **ReactJS Setup:** Initialized the project with ReactJS, setting up the components for input fields (grades, credits) and result display.
- **State Management:** Managed user input and calculated CGPA using React's state and hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`).
- **Responsive Design:** Ensured the application is responsive using CSS for seamless use across devices.
- **User Input Validation:** Implemented JavaScript functions to validate user inputs and prevent errors during calculation.

## **Deployment:**

- **Vercel Deployment:**
  - **Setup:** Configured the project for deployment on Vercel, linking the GitHub repository for continuous deployment.
  - **Build Process:** Vercel automatically built the React application and optimized it for production.
  - **Hosting:** Deployed the project on Vercel, making it accessible via a live URL with automatic updates on new commits.

## **Final Output:**

The project resulted in a fully functional and responsive CGPA calculator accessible online, providing students with a reliable tool to manage their academic performance.




# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
